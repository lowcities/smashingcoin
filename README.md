  This is a Node.js based conceptual blockchain creator. I did not create this code. I came from a published article written by [Alfrick Opidi](http://https://twitter.com/a_opidi) written for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/02/cryptocurrency-blockchain-node-js/.
  I made a few tweaks to the code but otherwise it it copied verbatim. I am facinated by blockchain technology and am a Node.js student, so this was a great pairing for me to learn concepts from both technologies.
